Current Architecture Notes:

Still To Improve:

reload_all() currently refreshes DetailView using:

self.current_character

after:

self.data_service.load_data()

Future improvement:

load data
find refreshed character
update current_character
refresh DetailView

Planned
Priority 1

RefreshService

Create:

app/services/refresh_service.py


Responsibilities:

refresh_table()
refresh_detail()
full_reload()
Weitere Zeilen anzeigen

Goal:

Centralize refresh logic
Remove duplicate reload paths
Improve debuggability

Priority 2

CharacterTable Optimization

Current behavior:

reload
→ recreate all task checkboxes
→ recreate all cell widgets
Weitere Zeilen anzeigen

Possible future optimization:

build once
update state only
Weitere Zeilen anzeigen

Needs investigation.

Priority 3

Selected Character Refresh

After reload:

self.current_character
Weitere Zeilen anzeigen

should be updated from freshly loaded character data.

Priority 4

UI Polish Pass

Review:

Alignment
Stretch factors
Colors
Spacing
Typography

Deferred until architecture refactor is complete.
