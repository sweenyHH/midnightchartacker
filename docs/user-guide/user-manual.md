# Warband Manager User Manual

## Introduction

Warband Manager is a desktop application for managing and tracking World of Warcraft characters.

The application combines imported character data with manually maintained information such as notes, weekly duties, vault progress, and warband tasks.

# Getting Started

## Import a Character

First, the data need to be exported from World of Warcraft:

The character data export needs to be done with the Addon CharacterExport , which can be downloaded here: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/characterexport](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/characterexport)

(The Addon CharacterExport is NOT created or maintained by me! Kudos to the Author Sitttar for his work.)

Recommanded settings for the Addon Export:

Check these boxes: 

- Bags
- Bank
- Character Stats
- Currencies
- Equipment
- Location
- Progress
- Reputations

(checking the other boxes will grow the export significantly while no data is used by Warband Manager)

To import a character:

1. Start Warband Manager.
2. Click **Paste Character Data**.
3. Paste a character export.
4. Confirm the import.

The character will appear in the character list.

Existing characters are automatically updated when a new export for the same character is imported.

User-maintained data such as Notes, Weekly Duties, and Vault Progress is preserved during imports.
