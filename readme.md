# Midnight Character Tracker

A desktop companion for **World of Warcraft** players that helps track character progress, currencies, Great Vault rewards, weekly activities, notes, and warband-wide tasks.

Midnight Character Tracker combines imported character data with user-managed tracking features and provides a clean overview of your entire roster in a single application.

The character data export needs to be done with the Addon CharacterExport , which can be downloaded here: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/characterexport](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/characterexport)

(The Addon CharacterExport is NOT created or maintained by me! Kudos to the Author Sitttar for his work.)

Recommanded settings for the Addon Export:

Check these boxes: 

- Bags
- Bank
- Character Stats
- Currencies
- Equipment
- Location
- Progress
- Reputations

(checking the other boxes will grow the export significantly while no data is used by Midnight Character Tracker)

## For Testers not playing WoW retail:

Please check the user guide for information on how to handle the test data. The guide can be found here: /docs/user-guide
